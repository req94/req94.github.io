                <h3>The Bay Area</h3>
                <p><span style="font-size: 20px;">S</span>an Jose, California was my birthplace. Being a Bay native, sometimes I hate seeing what's happened to Northern California. In many ways, it's becoming all of the bad things of Southern California; there's bad traffic, it's expensive, and tons of rich wanna-be's are flooding in. However things ain't really as bad as they seem, in my opinion. While it's true that the Bay Area has changed due to tech, for the same reason (in theory) it provides an immense amount of opportunity for people who truly want it.</p>
                
                <p><span style="font-size: 20px;">W</span>ithout being naive to the socioeconomic struggles of under-privileged communities, there <strong>HAS</strong> been progress. I, myself, am a member of an underprivileged group of society; a fatherless Mexican-American whose mother had to hold down multiple jobs to provide for my younger sister and I. For many years the system tried brainwashing me into thinking that the world was against me. However, when I took a step back to reflect, pray, and analyze the situation...There couldn't have been a better time to be born in, with regard to opportunity. Thanks to the internet and awesome places like CCSF, I have been able to provide for myself through my work in robotics, while at the same time learning how to program, hack (ethically of course), and do all sorts of other awesome things that I only dreamt of one day. I believe in the future.</p>
