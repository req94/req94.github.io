                <h3>How did I get started?</h3>
                <p>Building, modifying, and on occasion, breaking things has always fascinated me.</p>
                <p>My engineering career began on the Model S production line at Tesla Motors in 2014. At the same time, I was enrolled in engineering college courses, originally planning on pursuing an Aerospace Engineering degree, while going on to win two championships with Las Positas College's Men's Soccer Team. This was before picking up work as an electrician and realizing how crucial of a role electricity would play in the future. I then joined Lawrence Livermore National Lab's Engineering Technology program at Las Positas College and at one of the job fairs I met a few guys from Saildrone, a Bay Area startup located on the former Naval Base in Alameda. They were impressed by my resume and decided to throw me an offer, which caused some internal conflict because I knew I'd have to pause my studies to jump over and move to San Francisco. At this time I had been living in the Central Valley, but had been eager to move out for years, so I made the decision to accept.</p>
                <p>In 2018, I moved to San Francisco and continued working on robotics systems at Saildrone. After a year, I was in a pretty bad car crash that left me unable to work for a year. Thankfully, I had some money saved up and was able to take a whole year off to recover. During this time, I had heard of a hacking program at CCSF from a friend of my roommate. They explained to me that anyone could sign up and so I decided to check it out. Since I was young I have loved the internet and everything that has become possible thanks to it, so I was excited to learn more. I spoke with Sam Bowne, a professor at CCSF, and he directed me to his website, which quickly became one of my favorites. In the summer of 2019, I enrolled into the Cybersecurity program and dove right in.</p>
                <p>Now, after having learned how to ethically hack into things and look for vulnerabilities, I am diving deeper into programming. I have taken courses in Python, from beginner to advanced, and am currently enrolled in C++ & HTML/CSS. </p>
                <p>To be continued...</p>
                
                Here are a few good websites and my first webpage. Followed by a table of HTML list types, a picture of a cool car that I like, and some web definitions:
